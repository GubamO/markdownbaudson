### Me in a nutshell 

Passionate about music of all kinds, I really like to spend my life listening to it, I spend most of my time in my home studio doing that as well as learning audio mixing and besides that I'm mostly time behind my screens since I have been a computer and new technology enthusiast since my childhood

### You can always count on me when 
I usually like to find the answer myself, so I spend a lot of time researching alone and I can rack my brains for a long time on a small problem, so if you too have been stuck for a while, come see me to find out. 'we can combine our research, we will necessarily find the solution together!

### A funny story
i once found myself reluctantly on the zap of spion when i was a kid via a video of me around 10-11 years old rapping on webcammax with an awful headset and very short hair in gel filled spikes infamous.
